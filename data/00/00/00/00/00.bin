  |   Sydney Hunter and the Curse of the Mayan is a love-letter to 8-bit    |
  |   action adventure games with challenging platformer gameplay and a     |
  |   huge number of Maya-inspired bosses.                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   You play as Sydney Hunter, adventurer supreme, who by sheer luck      |
  |   manages to get trapped inside a massive Maya pyramid. He soon         |
  |   discovers that the "Feathered Serpent" Kukulkan has broken up the     |
  |   sacred Haab calendar into seven individual pieces and has hidden      |
  |   them inside the very same pyramid!                                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Widespread chaos and a time freeze will certainly follow if the       |
  |   Haab calendar isn't located and put back together. With the support   |
  |   of the local Mayan population, Sydney Hunter must now find all        |
  |   seven pieces of the Haab calendar, defeat Kukulkan, and return        |
  |   peace and balance to the Mayan civilization.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Are you ready to beat the Curse of the Mayan?                         |
  |                                                                         |

  |   Update Notes: v1.2.3 (v131072). Firmware 9.1.0 and master key 9.0     |
  |   are required.                                                         |

  |   Updated Controls: Added a keyboard mapping option and changed         |
  |   controller default controls so both Y and A are now assigned to       |
  |   Attack. The "Up + Attack" feature - intended for those using the      |
  |   awesome NES-style Switch controller - is now disabled by default      |
  |   (preventing accidental use by those using the standard                |
  |   controllers).                                                         |

  |   Improved Difficulty Balance: The game is now more forgiving;          |
  |   players remain invincible a little longer after taking a hit - and    |
  |   a brand new save spot has been included at a convenient location      |
  |   early in the game.                                                    |
